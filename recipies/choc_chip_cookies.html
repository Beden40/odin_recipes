    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour </li>
                <li> 2 teaspoons baking powder </li>
                <li> 1 ¾ teaspoons kosher salt </li>
                <li> ½ teaspoon baking soda </li> 
                <li> 10 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened </li>
                <li> ⅔ cup light brown sugar, packed </li>
                <li> ⅓ cup granulated sugar </li>
                <li> tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li> 1 large egg </li>
                <li> 2 ¼ cups chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda
             in a medium mixing bowl until combined; set aside. 
            </li> 

            <li>
            Using a stand mixer or electric hand mixer, cream the butter, brown sugar, 
            and granulated sugar for 5 minutes, or until light and fluffy. Scrape down 
            the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the vanilla extract 
            and egg; beat at medium-low speed until incorporated. 
            </li>  

            <li>
            Add the flour mixture, beating at medium-low speed until incorporated. 
            With a rubber spatula, mix in the chocolate chips by hand, scraping the sides of the 
            bowl to incorporate any remaining flour. Cover the bowl and chill the dough 10-15 minutes 
            (to make it easier to handle). 
            </li>

            <li>
            Scoop the dough into 6 equal portions. (You can use a heaping ½ cup 
            measure to portion the dough into 6 mounds.) Place the mounds 
            on a parchment paper lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, 
            and refrigerate 3 hours, or up to overnight. 
            </li>  

            <li>
            Preheat oven to 400°F. 
            </li>

            <li>   
            Arrange 3 portions of dough on a parchment paper-lined 
            sheet pan (keep remaining dough portions refrigerated). Bake 400°F for 15-18 
            minutes or until cookies are golden-brown and appear set, rotating pan after 
            10 minutes. Repeat process with remaining 3 portions of dough. Cool the cookies
             on the sheet pan for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool 
             completely, at least 30 minutes.       
          </li>
        </ol>
